# Desktop Ponies

8 bit ponies on your desktop.

Desktop Ponies lets you choose some ponies from [My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic) to trot around your desktop whilst you work.

The ponies will move around on screen performing a variety of custom animations. They also talk occasionally and some ponies will interact with each other.

There are over 190 ponies and other characters from the show included. There is also a wide array of OCs available and you can create your own ponies too.
